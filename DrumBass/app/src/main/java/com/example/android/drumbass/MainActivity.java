 Answer your Question
 QUESTION 2: Another "next step" would be to be able to click on the song you want from the playlist and then update the "Home activity" with the selected song's info. Which would   be the correct way to do it?

                 Great job in using explicit Intent to call other activities.
                 An explicit intent is one that you use to launch a specific app component, such as a particular activity or service in your app. To create an explicit intent, define the component name for the Intent objectâ€”all other intent properties are optional.*/

                 When you open another activity, you create a new one, this activity goes to a stack of activities and if you continue creating more the stack continue growing. It is a very good practice to add finish(); after startActivity(your intent) to avoid it. With the exception of the MainActivity.*/

/**Suggestion
 Instead of using multiple anonymous instances of the clickListener, you can directly implement this in your activity and then using switch statements, you can reduce the number of lines of codes as you can learn from this example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4987721/5770629*/
